In other words, if a class is a subclass of another class, it should be able to substitute its parent class without causing errors or unexpected behavior."

    "In the incorrect implementation, the Penguin class, which is a subclass of Bird, violates the Liskov Substitution Principle by raising a NotImplementedError in its fly method. This means that a Penguin cannot be seamlessly substituted for a generic Bird, and the program may break if such substitution is attempted.\n",
    "\n",

In the example, both Sparrow and Penguin can be used interchangeably where a Bird is expected, maintaining the integrity of the program."
