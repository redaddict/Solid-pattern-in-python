    "The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) is one of the SOLID principles, and it states that a class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use. In other words, a client should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. This principle encourages the creation of specific, client-focused interfaces."
